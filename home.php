    Most of all Ginny--part Schnauzer, part Siberian Husky, part angel from heaven--has taught me the most important lesson in life, that life is not worth living without love, that giving love is more rewarding than getting it, and that the humblest creatures, the least advantaged creatures, are worthy of the greatest outpouring of love. It's a spiritual message, that all life is precious (matters), all life is short, and that, just as human beings have immortal souls, so do animals have immortal souls, because they, too, were created by God.

     Animal rescue is a broad term that refers to any effort to save animals from cruelty and abuse. An animal rescue operation, whether law enforcement or civilian, identifies animal cruelty, recovers animals from substandard conditions, and makes every effort to give those animals better lives.

    Itâ€™s difficult to quantify concepts like suffering. Additionally, statistics are available on some animals, but not on others.

However, we have to work with what we know. Animal rescue efforts often target certain species or even breeds. Among dogs, for example, there are many animal rescue operations targeted at pitbulls, Golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, and other specific breeds.

Dogs, cats, and other small animals are easier on animal rescue professionals. Larger animals, such as horses and livestock, take up more space.
